# Moves-of-a-knight
2 little games with pawns and a knight

Game 1 (Moves_of_a_knight.py): Select a number of pawns between 1 and 63. Take the knight to capture the pawns, which do not move in this game.
Room for improvement: Calculate the best way the capture the pawns (minimum number of moves = recursive function???).

Game 2 (Moves_of_a_knight_8pawns.py): One knight and opposing 8 pawns are correctly distributed on the chess board. Pawns move forward and can capture the knight on a diagonal field in front. Knight must prevent a pawn becoming a queen.
